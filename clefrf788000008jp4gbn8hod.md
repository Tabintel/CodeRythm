# Documenting My Learning Journey

I've noticed a pattern in my learning journey: I start off strong, but after a couple of weeks, I lose track of my progress and end up starting over again. This habit has held me back for too long, and I've decided to do something about it. Learning is about obtaining new knowledge and improving upon what we already know, and keeping a record of our growth and processes is essential for efficient learning.

That's why I'm using [Gary Vee's](https://garyvaynerchuk.com/) "[DOCUMENT. don't create](https://garyvaynerchuk.com/creating-content-that-builds-your-personal-brand/)" method to track my learning journey. Documenting is a version of creating that allows me to be myself and keep myself accountable. I'll be writing down what I learn each day or after each practice session and sharing my progress with others to stay accountable.

By documenting my journey, I'll have a log of my starting process, which I can refer back to in the future. It's all part of telling my story and keeping track of my ups and downs along the way. As [Gary Vee](https://garyvaynerchuk.com/) said, ["Starting is the most important part and the biggest hurdle that most people are facing."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7yOimDTzyI) By documenting my journey, I'm overcoming that hurdle and making progress toward my goals.

In the coming weeks, I'll be starting my coding journey by learning the `programming language` [Go](https://go.dev/). I believe I have all the resources I need, and now it's time to put them to use. I choose to tell my story by documenting my journey, and I invite you to follow along as I learn and grow.
