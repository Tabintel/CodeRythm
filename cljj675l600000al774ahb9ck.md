Do you know what a "dock" is? In the sea, it's an enclosed area where ships are loaded, unloaded, and repaired. But in software development, "dockerize" has a different meaning.

In this step-by-step guide, we will walk through the process of deploying a Rust app on Spheron Compute using Docker. Docker allows us to package our Rust application into a container, which can be easily deployed and managed on Spheron Compute for seamless hosting and scaling.

## Prerequisites:

To follow this guide, please have the following in place:

* Basic understanding of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
    
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) account and familiarity with Docker concepts.
    
* Spheron account - you can sign up [here!](https://spheron.network/)
    
* Text editor - [Visual Studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred one.
    

## Dockerization, Rust and Spheron

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Before we begin, let's have a refresher on <em>Dockerization, Rust programming language and Spheron.</em></div>
</div>

[**Dockerization**](https://developerexperience.io/articles/dockerizing) is the process of creating a Docker image containing your app and its dependencies. Think of it as when you're travelling to a different country, you gather all the essential items you need for your trip. This helps you easily move them from one place to another.

The Docker image can then be run in an environment that has Docker installed. It ensures portability, consistent behaviour and easy deployment of your app. Read more about Dockers [here](https://medium.com/uptime-99/the-benefits-of-using-docker-for-development-and-operations-2c5256ad89bc).

[**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a versatile programming language used for a wide range of applications, from building backend systems and network services to developing web browsers and game engines.  
If you're building applications with a focus on safety and performance, then Rust is your sure plug.

[Spheron](https://spheron.network/) is a decentralized cloud platform for deploying and hosting web and dapp.

Spheron compute is a feature of the Spheron platform that specifically caters to the hosting and execution of applications.

It leverages the power of decentralized networks to provide benefits such as improved security, resilience, and cost-efficiency.

<div data-node-type="callout-text">Now that we've cleared the air ðŸ˜‰, let's build and dockerize!</div>
</div>

### **Step 1: Create a Rust App**

On your PC, Mac or Linux, create a project folder (give it a cool name) and open it in your favourite code editor. Here, we are using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">If not already installed, download and install <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" style="pointer-events: none">Rust</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.docker.com/get-started/" style="pointer-events: none">Docker</a>.</div>
</div>

In the terminal, create a new Rust app using the following command:

```bash
cargo new my-rust-app
```

This will create a new directory in the project folder, named `my-rust-app` with the basic structure of a Rust app. Replace `my-rust-app` with the name you want.

### **Step 2: Write Your Rust Code**

Open the `main.rs` file in your text editor and write the code for your Rust app.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1688131938383/82b2ae49-d1ba-44a6-b2a3-893cb8a2295e.png align="center")

You can use this code as a starting point:

```rust
fn main() {

println!("Hello, Spheron!");

}
```

Save the file when you're done.

At this point, your project folder should look like this:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1688131217270/05caae19-0606-407a-85e9-295671bdfba5.png align="center")

### **Step 3: Create a Dockerfile**

Next, create a **Dockerfile** (without an extension) in the root directory of your Rust app. The Dockerfile contains instructions for building the Docker image for your app. Open a text editor and create a new file named `Dockerfile`, then add the following content:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Rust image as the base image

FROM rust:latest

# Create a new directory for the app

WORKDIR /usr/src/my-rust-app

# Copy the app files into the container

COPY . .

# Build the app

RUN cargo build --release

# Set the entry point command

CMD ["./target/release/my-rust-app"]
```

Save the Dockerfile when you're done. You'll see it added as shown below.

### **Step 4: Build the Docker Image**

Now, it's time to build the Docker image for your Rust app. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of your app (where the Dockerfile is located), and run the following command:

```dockerfile
docker build -t my-rust-app:latest .
```

This command builds the Docker image using the specified Dockerfile and assigns the tag `my-rust-app:latest` to the image. Make sure to include the dot (`.`) at the end, as it indicates the build context.

### **Step 5: Push the Image to Docker Hub (Optional)**

If you want to push the Docker image to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) or any other container registry, follow these steps:

* Log in to your [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account using the command `docker login`.
    
* Tag the Docker image with your Docker Hub username and repository name using the following command:
    

```bash
docker tag my-rust-app:latest <your-docker-username>/my-rust-app:latest
```

* Push the tagged image to Docker Hub using the following command:
    

```bash
docker push <your-docker-username>/my-rust-app:latest
```

### **Step 6: Deploy on Spheron Compute**

* Log in to your [Spheron account](https://spheron.network) and **"Start with Compute"** to deploy your Rust app.

* Then click on **"New Cluster"** to create a new cluster.

<div data-node-type="callout-text">A cluster refers to a group of compute instances or containers that work together to provide the resources and computing power needed to run your applications.</div>
</div>

* Select the **"Import from Docker Registry"** option, and fill in the *Name, Image and Tag fields.*
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1688164237023/f24aeae9-2375-49ed-ac11-b4caefeb1f5b.png align="center")

* **Name:** Choose a unique name for your deployment. It should be a name that helps you identify the purpose of your Rust app.
    
* **Image:** Next, enter the **image** of your Docker container. This refers to the name of the Docker image you pushed to Docker Hub. In our case, the image name is `my-rust-app`.
    
* **Tag:** The tag represents a specific version or configuration of your Rust app. For our sample application, you can use a tag like `v1.0` or `demo`. This ensures that the correct version of your Rust app is deployed.
    
* **Select instance plan:** Choose the appropriate plan for your Rust app.
    
* **Configure port mapping:** Specify the container port and the exposed port.
    
* **Set environment variables:** Add any required variables, including secret keys.
    
* **Choose deployment region:** Select your preferred region or leave it blank for automatic deployment.
    
* **Advanced configuration:** Customize additional settings if needed.
    
* **Click Deploy:** Initiate the deployment process.
    

## **Conclusion**

**And that's all there is to it!**

Thanks for reading till the end. ðŸ˜Ž
