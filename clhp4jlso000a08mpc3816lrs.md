I started my tech journey in 2017 - I began with hardware - laptops, desktops, and printers. Then I wrote my first line of code in 2018. One major problem I had then was consistency. I will write about this in a different article. üôÇ  
  
Now, it's time for JavaScript May (!hem). If you're new to coding, that means "JavaScript May, not hem". A play with words and code. üòÅ

Welcome to Series 1 of our JavaScript journey! In this article, we'll embark on an exciting adventure into the world of JavaScript and discover its immense potential in shaping the web. So, fasten your seatbelts and get ready to dive into the captivating realm of code!

## Why Learn JavaScript?

JavaScript, the language of the web, empowers you to bring life to static web pages. By mastering JavaScript, you become a digital sorcerer, conjuring interactivity, dynamic content, and delightful user experiences. It's like waving a wand and making the web dance to your tune!

## Overview of JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that adds functionality to web pages. It's like the secret sauce that adds flavour and zest to a plain HTML and CSS dish. With JavaScript, you can create interactive forms, perform calculations, manipulate elements, and even communicate with servers to fetch and display data.

## History of JavaScript

Let's take a quick trip down memory lane to appreciate the origins of JavaScript. Born in the mid-90s, it was initially created by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) in just 10 days. Fun fact: it was originally named "Mocha" and later "LiveScript" before finally settling on "JavaScript." Today, JavaScript has become the backbone of modern web development, powering countless websites and applications.

## Setting up Your Development Environment

Before we dive into writing JavaScript code, let's ensure we have the right setup. We'll need a text editor and a web browser. Popular choices include [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [Atom](https://atom.io/). Pick your favourite editor, install it, and make sure you have a reliable web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari at your fingertips.

## Writing Your First JavaScript Code

Now, it's time to write our first lines of JavaScript code. Open your favourite text editor, create a new file, and save it with a `.js` extension. Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" example:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Brace yourself for the magic! Open your web browser's developer console, paste the code, and press Enter. Voil√†! The console displays our greeting, marking the beginning of our JavaScript journey.

## Understanding Basic Syntax and Variables

JavaScript, like any language, has its own syntax and rules. Let's explore some essential concepts. Variables act as containers to store data. We can declare them using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords. Here's an example:

```javascript
let name = "John";
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
```

In this code snippet, we declare a variable `name` and assign it the value "John". We then use string concatenation to display a personalized greeting in the console. The possibilities are endless as you combine variables, operators, and functions to create powerful JavaScript code.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the first leg of our JavaScript series! In this article, we explored the allure of JavaScript, its fascinating history, and the foundational steps to get started. We wrote our first lines of code, greeting the world with a resounding "Hello!" We also dipped our toes into the realm of variables and syntax, unlocking the building blocks of JavaScript magic.

In the upcoming articles in this series, we'll dive deeper into JavaScript's enchanting features and explore its superpowers. So stay tuned, keep practising, and soon you'll be a JavaScript wizard!

üöÄ Keep coding and let the JavaScript adventures begin.  
  
Practice, build, and keep on learning - that is the way to go. üë®üèæ‚ÄçüíªüöÄ
