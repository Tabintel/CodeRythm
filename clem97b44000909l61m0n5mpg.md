# Roadmap to Learning Cloud Computing

Have you been considering a career in Cloud Computing but don‚Äôt know where to start? A friend of mine recently asked how he could get started in Cloud Computing, and I did some research to come up with this roadmap. After creating a roadmap, I realized that many others might benefit from it as well. That's why I'm sharing it here as an article.

If you're also looking to become a cloud computing expert, this guide is for you. It's designed to help you develop the skills and knowledge needed to become job-ready in cloud computing.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is like having a giant computer that you can use from anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. You can save your pictures, videos, and documents on this big computer and access them from your phone, tablet, or computer. It's like having a magic box that holds all your important stuff!
